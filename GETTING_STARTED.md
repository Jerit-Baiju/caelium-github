# Getting Started with Caelium

Welcome to the Caelium project! We’re thrilled that you're interested in contributing to our vision of a unified, socially immersive digital platform. This guide will help you get familiar with our project structure, code of conduct, and guidelines for contributing to ensure a smooth start.

## 🏗 Project Structure

Caelium is divided into two primary repositories:

- **[caelium](https://github.com/CaeliumHQ/caelium)**: This repository contains the backend code, developed using Django. It manages API services and core functionalities.
- **[caelium-next](https://github.com/CaeliumHQ/caelium-next)**: This repository houses the frontend code, built with Next.js. It provides the Progressive Web App (PWA) interface and user interactions.

> [!NOTE]
> The frontend interface in `caelium-next` is dependent on the backend API in `caelium`. Ensure that the backend is running for the frontend to function correctly.

Each repository has its own `docs` folder and README file containing setup and development instructions, so you can dive into either the backend or frontend development based on your expertise.

## 🚀 Setting Up Your Development Environment
