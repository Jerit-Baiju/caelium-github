## 🏗 Project Structure

Caelium is divided into multiple repositories, each serving a specific purpose:

- **[caelium](https://github.com/CaeliumHQ/caelium)**: Backend code developed using Django. It manages API services and core functionalities.
- **[caelium-next](https://github.com/CaeliumHQ/caelium-next)**: Frontend code built with Next.js. It provides the Progressive Web App (PWA) interface and user interactions.
- **[caelium-admin](https://github.com/CaeliumHQ/caelium-admin)**: Administrative interface for managing the platform.
- **[caelium-fms](https://github.com/CaeliumHQ/caelium-fms)**: Financial Management System for handling budgets, expenses, and financial tracking.

> [!NOTE]
> The frontend interfaces are dependent on the backend API in `caelium`. Ensure that the backend is running for the frontend applications to function correctly.

Each repository has its own documentation and README file containing setup and development instructions, so you can dive into any area based on your expertise.
